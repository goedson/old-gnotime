    This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
    There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
    likely that it would be much leaner.
    
    However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
    built with tables.

            <p class="p1"><span>The main window screen, showing all-time and daily totals:</span></p>
            <img src="./images/gnome2-main-small.png" />
            
            <p class="p1"><span>The same main window screen, but with additional columns
            enabled to show project status.   Note the new notes-taking
            area at the bottom of the screen.</span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span>The inactivity popup dialog, which triggers when
            the keyboard and mouse has been idle some period of time.
            Note how this allows a project to be credited with an 
            adjustable amount of time.  Being able to adjust the time
            credited directly, without having to fuss with menus and 
            GUI dialogs is a very handy feature when you are distracted by 
            interruptions. </span></p>

            The dialog box for specifying project-planning status.
            The use of this dialog is optional, but can be useful for 
            ranking the importance and urgency of to-do list items.
            Note the distinction between importance and urgency:
            An <b><i>important</i></b> task is one that must be done,
            sooner or later.  An <b><i>urgent</i></b> task should be
            done as soon as possible. </span></p>

            Below is a view of the time report, as viewed by
            the built-in HTML viewer.  Because this report is just
            plain HTML, it can be saved to a file, emailed, or 
            posted to a web site. 
            <a href="example-time-report.html">Here's the 
            same report, as a web page</a>. </span></p>
            <img src="./images/gtt-2.2.0-journal.png">
            
            <p class="p1"><span>
            Here are some other reports that GnoTime can generate:
            <ul>
            <li>Here's the <a href="example-journal.html">'Journal'
                report</a>, a view of the same data, 
                presented in a blog-like diary format.
            <li>Here's an <a href="example-invoice.html">example invoice</a>
                based on the same data (actually, a bit more data to 
                make a better example).
            <li>Here's the same data, presented as a 
                <a href="example-daily-report.html">Daily Activity Report</a>.
            
            <li>A <a href="roadmap.html">Status Report</a>, showing 
                a list of projects, and a writeup of the status of each.
                Yes, this status report just happens, quite by accident, 
                to be reporting the status of some future GnoTime features.
            <li>Here's the same status report, presented
                with the <a href="example-todo.html">To-Do Report</a>.
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            All of the above reports are generated from report templates
            written in HTML, with embeded markup to display the various
            bits of data.  This means that if you are knowledgable in 
            HTML you can readily modify these report templates, and 
            design your own reports.  In particular, if you hate these
            colors and style, you can change them as you wish.
            <br><br>
            When you view these reports natively in GnoTime, each of the 
            entries shows up as a hyper-link. You can click on each link
            to bring up a menu, and then, from the menu, edit, add or 
            cut-n-paste entires. For example,
            individual time intervals may be modified. </span></p>
