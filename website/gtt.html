<br>

The Gnome Time Tracker is a to-do list/diary/journal tool
that can track the amount of time spent on projects, and,
among other things, generate reports and invoices based on 
that time.  I've used it to keep shopping lists, organize ideas, 
track bug reports, keep a diary of activities, provide 
weekly status reports to management, and even as a consultant billing
system.  The reason it can be used for all of these things
is that it supports five basic, simple features:
     <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Multiple <b>To-Do Lists</b> that can be sorted by the 
    priority/importance of the tasks in the list.  The to-do
    items can be organized into categories, arranged in a
    heirarchical way.  This makes it easy to maintain 
    both business and personal items in the list, or
    handle many different projects, while keeping them
    separate from each other.
     <br><br>
<li>A pair of <b>Diary/Journal</b> areas that can be used 
    to keep long and detailed notes and diary entries.
    The project description area allows a multi-paragraph 
    description or status to be typed in.  The diary 
    area allows day-to-day notes to be associated with
    a set of timestamps, so that one has a record of what
    one did on any given day.
     <br><br>
<li>A <b>Running Timer</b>, with time totals, for each 
    project/task.  One starts the timer by clicking on a 
    task: it will measure the amount of time that you are
    in front of the computer.  If it detects that the 
    keyboard/mouse are idle, it will stop the clock.  
    If the clock stays stopped too long, it will nag you to 
    start it up again.  You can view time totals by day, 
    week, month or year.
     <br><br>
<li>A <b>Billing Status</b> dialog for each diary entry. 
    You can mark any given diary entry as billable/non-billable,
    paid or pending, and set the billing rate. Each
    project can also be marked up with a set of 
    project-planning information: planed start, end and 
    due dates, hours to finish, percent-complete.  
    This is in addition to assigning an urgency/importance
    to each project, as well as a status (completed/in-progress
    not-started/canceled).

     <br><br>
<li>A half-dozen different HTML <b>Reports</b> that can
    slice and dice your lists.  There's a Journal report
    that shows all of the diary entries for one given project. 
    There's an Invoice
    report that summarizes the time spent on each entry,
    and computes a dollar amount for it.  There's a Status
    Report that prints the title of each project, together
    with the paragraph-long descriptions of each.  There's
    a ToDo report, which prints only the project title, the 
    importance/urgency, and the completed/in-progress/not-started 
    status.  The Daily report summarizes the total time
    spent on a day-by-day basis, and lists each of the projects
    that were worked on in a given day. Each of these reprts
    can be customized.  And, because they're HTML, you can
    even publish them as web pages.  (Yes, I've thought of
    using GnoTime as a weblog management/publishing tool).
     <br><br>
</ul>


<h2>More Details</h2>
We'd like to tell you a bit more about some of the features:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Simple GUI, Simple Navigation</b>
<dd>We've worked to try to make the GUI as simple as we can,
    and we're not done yet.  GnoTime will auto-save data,
    so that you don't have to.  (It also means no data loss
    if something crashes).  The heirarchical tree of projects
    is managed through drag-n-drop, and can be navigated from
    the keyboard, with arrows keys and carriage returns.
    The left/right arrow keys expand/collapse project lists.
    Hitting return starts and stops the timer.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Auto-Merge/Cleanup of Short Intervals Support</b>
<dd> We also try to unclutter a mess of timer stops/starts
     by trying to clean up time-keeping cruft.
     Extremely short time intervals are automatically removed
     from the logs (the length is configurable).  
     Slightly longer but still short intervals
     are auto-merged into nearby neighbors. Short gaps between intervals
     are coalesced as well.  You can specify a time period of 0 seconds
     to turn these features off.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>User-Customizable HTML-based Reports</b>
<dd>The journal/report GUI is based on template HTML pages.  If you know
     HTML, then you can create customized report pages.  Particularly
     handy for slapping the company logo and mailing address on the top 
     of the page, and generating a unique, custom look.
     User-defined reports (contained in <tt>ghtml</tt> files) 
     can be added to the
     menus by typing in the filename into the 'New Report' GUI dialog.
     <br><br>
     Admittedly, hacking on HTML templates is not the easiest
     thing in the world:  you can't (yet) customize reports
     with a WYSIWYG eidtor (although we are contemplating one).
     But we figure that HTML can't be that hard: the nerd in 
     you will not be intimidated.  It might be a bit scary to
     mention scheme at this point, but lets just say that
     you can be totally ignorant of scheme and still be able
     to do some pretty fancy customization, above and beyond
     what HTML lets you do, by hacking on the scheme in the report
     templates.
     <br><br>
     Fresh in version 2.1.9 is the ability to embedd simple SQL 
     queries in the report templates.  We know that many of you
     power users know SQL, so we figure you'll like this.  The
     SQL gives you the ability to query for only those projects/tasks
     that meet a certain criteria, which is handy if you've got 
     years worth of data and years worth of project lists and 
     to-do items, and you want to just fish out the ones from 
     last month.  
     <br><br>
     Disclaimer: we're still working on SQL support. It works,
     but you can't yet query everything.
     
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Shell Commands</b>
<dd>A shell command can be executed whenever a project timer is 
    started or stopped.  The project title, description and other 
    parameters can be passed to the shell command.  We don't know
    what the hell you power users do with this feature; its 
    been in GTT since the very earliest releases. 
     <br><br>

<dt><b>XML File Format</b>
<dd>All project and journal data are stored in an XML file format.
    This should simplify future interoperability and data access concerns.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Multi-Language Support</b>
<dd>The GnoTime menus and messages have been translated to dozens of 
    languages.  There are message catalogues for the following locales:
    <tt>
    az bg ca cs da de el en_GB es et eu fi fr ga gl hu it ja ko lt lv ms nl
    nn no pl pt pt_BR ro ru sk sl sv ta tr uk vi wa zh_CN zh_TW
    </tt>
    Some of these translations need an update; they're quite old and
    out of date. We need help here.
    Translations are needed for the manual. Actually, the manual needs 
    a complete re-write; its three years old, and doesn't discuss most 
    of the newer features.

<h1>Screenshots</h1>
The following screenshots are from the current Gnome2 version of
GnoTime, unless otherwise noted.
<br><br>
The main window screen, showing all-time and daily totals:
<br>
<img src="gnome2-main-small.png">
<br><br>

The same main window screen, but with additional columns
enabled to show project status.   Note the new notes-taking
area at the bottom of the screen.
<br>
<img src="gnome2-main-notes.png">
<br><br>

The inactivity popup dialog, which triggers when
the keyboard and mouse has been idle some period of time.
Note how this allows a project to be credited with an 
adjustable amount of time.  Being able to adjust the time
credited directly, without having to fuss with menus and 
GUI dialogs is a very handy feature when you are distracted by 
interruptions.
<br>
<img src="gnome2-idle-timeout.png">
<br><br>
The dialog box for specifying project-planning status.
The use of this diaolog is optional, but can be useful for 
ranking the importance and urgency of to-do list items.
Note the distinction between importance and urgency:
An <b><i>important</i></b> task is one that must be done,
sooner or later.  An <b><i>urgent</i></b> task should be
done as soon as possible.

Below is the short-form view of journal entries
(this screenshot is from the gnome-1.4.1 version).
Note that this report is is generated as html, 
displayed in a gtkhtml window.
Clicking on the hot-links brings up a popup
menu that allows you to cut, paste and edit the entries.

You can create much better looking reports by modifying
the html template for this report.  If you know html,
this is easy to do.

<h1>News</h1>
The latest releases continues to focus on usability and convenience 
features, making GnoTime easier to use and thus more powerful.

    <br><br>
<dl>


<dt><b>New in the 2.1.8 release</b>
<dd>This release adds support for simple report queries.  In particular,
    reports can now be generated for all tasks that occured between a
    pair of dates;  an extremely general query system is now in place,
    although it is not used except to perform this simple date query.
    <br><br>
    Toshio Kuratomi provided a major cleanup of the documentation 
    subsystem.  Goedson Teixeira Paixao provided a new pt_BR translation.
    A variety of minor bugs were fixed, includeing a crash of the 
    'yelp' help browser.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.7 release</b>
<dd>Version 2.1.7 fixes some internationalization bugs, and ports the 
    configuration system to GConf2. The 'custom reports' menu is now 
    editable.  
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.6 release</b>
<dd>The "Daily Report" will show not only the total hours worked,
    day by day, but will also show a bullited list of tasks worked 
    that day.  The main window display can now show total hours worked
    for previous day and previous week.  Sub-projects can now be fetched 
    via scheme, allowing them to be included in reports.  The scheme
    subsystem now includes an elementary type system, allowing more
    complex structures to be built.  A half-dozen different crashes 
    have been fixed.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.5 release</b>
<dd>The main window has been reformulated in a big way:  It
    now includes sub-panels for editing project and diary notes.
    This 'notes area' makes it far more convenient to make
    extensive notes and 'blog' your way through a set of projects.
    <br><br>
    Also fixes bugs with backup timestamps, also with cut-n-paste
    of project trees.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.4 release</b>
<dd>The scheme interface re-design has been finished.
    This means that the HTML reports are far, far more
    configurable, and can be made to look much prettier.
    The old, nasty table-formatting features have been removed.
    It also means that tab-delimited export now works cleanly,
    and other export formats can be easily added.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.3 release</b>
<dd>The time credited to a project after the keyboard inactivity 
    timer has tripped is now very easily adjustable.  Thus, if
    the timer tripped because you were on the phone, you can now
    trivially credit the project with any time, from zero to 
    the full interval since the last keyboard/mouse activity,
    by simply adjusting a slider in the timeout popup.
    <br><br>

    Backup copies of data automatically saved, automatically
    pruned back, thus providing an archive of old data as well
    as avoiding catastrophic data loss.
    <br><br>


<dt><b>New in the 2.1.2 release</b>
<dd>A "major" change in the user interface: one must now
    double-click to start a project timer running.  This 
    makes navigation and task editing much easier and more
    robust than the single-click interface, which was prone
    to accidental-click problems, especially on laptop touchpads.
    This makes GnoTime much more usable on laptops.
    The 2.1.2 version is also the first official stable, 
    non-beta release GnoTime. (December 27, 2002)
    <br><br>
    The 2.1.2 version also included:
    <ul>
    <li>Added new to-do list report
    <li>Run shell commands when project started/stopped (fixed)
    <li>Added tab-delimited export of to-do list
    <li>Removed cause of possible crashes (buffer over-run
        for large datasets).
    <li>Remember what state tree was left in between sessions.
    <li>Much improved scheme support in reports
    <li>Language translations now included as part of dist
    <li>Can now save HTML reports to file (again)
    <li>Now detects inactivity due to laptop shutdown
    <li>Fix start/stop timer icon in toolbar
    </ul>
<dt><b>History:</b>
<dd>GnoTime used to be known as GTT and was a part of the <tt>gnome-utils</tt>
    package.  It has now been split out of that package, and ported to 
    Gnome2.  The Gnome2 port is now officially 'stable' and (more-or-less)
    ready for general, production use.  It does still have a variety 
    of blemishes, but these don't seem to be show-stoppers at this point.
    <p>
    Note that the gnome-1.4 version of GTT/GnoTime is still
    available as a part of the 
    <tt>gnome-utils</tt> package on <tt>cvs.gnome.org</tt>,
    in the <tt>gnome-utils-1-4</tt> branch.
    It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
    If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
    recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
    should check out the gnome-1.4 branch, as follows:
    <tt>
    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout -r
    gnome-utils-1-4 gnome-utils
    </tt>
    Please note that this gnome-1.4 branch fixes some critical gtt
    bugs!  Please note that these fixes are NOT in the latest 
    gnome-utils 1.4 tarball! 
<p>
</dl>
<br><br>

<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
GnoTime is currently written in C and Scheme. C is used to implement 
all of the core functions, whereas Scheme is used to generate the 
HTML reports.  The Scheme/HTML combo was choosen in order to make
it easy to customize reports, while allowing the result to be easily
viewed in a browser, sent by email, etc.  The GUI system is 
all in Gnome, using the Glade interfce designer.
The file format is in XML, folloowing current trends.
<br><br>


<h1>Roadmap</h1>
GnoTime still needs some serious work in several areas. Help is needed.
<dl>
<dt><b>GUI Enhancements</b>
<dd>The GUI can be made simpler, easier and more powerful at the same
    time.   This is my current development focus: improve usability
    without adding feature bloat.  Easier said than done.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>E-Mail Reports</b>
<dd>There are two things I'd like to do that one would think are real
    easy: add a button allowing a report to be emailed, and add a button
    to automatically view a report with your default web browser.
    Amazingly, this is quite hard, and at this time, Gnome ofers no
    infrastructure to make this easy.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Better Report Generation</b>
<dd>Certain reports, especially the invoice reports, would benefit
    from a better report generator.  I'd like to add buttons to
    show/hide completed projects, etc.

    <br><br>
<dt><b>GnuCash Integration</b>
<dd>It should be possible to import GnoTime invoices into GnuCash.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>SQL Support</b>
<dd>A frequent request is for a multi-user version of GnoTime.
    A basic level of multi-user capabilities can be achieved by
    adding support for an SQL backend.  This should be relatively easy,
    as all of the project and journal functions were segregated when
    the XML file format was added.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>Web Tinkering</b>
<dd>GnoTime already uses some of the buzzwords of the web: HTML and XML.
    That makes it an interesting playground for experimenting with
    web-enabling technology.  Can it be made into a client-server
    system, running on the open internet?
    <br><br>
<dt><b>Project Management Integration</b>
<dd>It might be interesting to have GnoTime work as applet or 
    embedable component for an extended/sophisticated project 
    management system.  For example, it should be interesting to make
    GnoTime a front end to something like 
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/toutdoux/en/index.html">TouxDoux</a>, 
    or <a href="http://mrproject.codefactory.se/">MrProject</a>
    or even the web/PHP-based 
    <a href="http://dcl.sourceforge.net/">
    Double Choco Latte</a>.  Alternately, GnoTime could
    be integrated into simpler calendar/todo systems, such as Evolution. 

</dl>
