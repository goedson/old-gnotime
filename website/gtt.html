<br>

The Gnome Time Tracker is a desktop utility for tracking
the amount of time spent on projects, and generating configurable
reports and invoices based on that time.   It also makes for a 
good to-to list tracker and idea organizer, allowing to-do list
items to be sorted even while providing ample notes-taking area
associated with each item.

<p>
GnoTime used to be known as GTT and was a part of the <tt>gnome-utils</tt>
package.  It has now been split out of that package, and ported to 
Gnome2.  The Gnome2 port is now officially 'stable' and (more-or-less)
ready for general, production use.  It does still have a variety 
of blemishes, but these don't seem to be show-stoppers at this point.
<p>
GnoTime has the following features:
<dl>
<dt><b>Basic Stop-Watch Support</b>
<dd>At its core, GnoTime is a fancy stop-watch: you can click on
    an icon to start and stop one of any number of timers.
    It is the times measured by these clocks that make up
    the core data that GnoTime works with.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Project Planning Support</b>
<dd>Well, OK, "project planning" may be an overstatement.  But GnoTime
    does provide basic to-do list support, including the ability 
    to rank by importance and urgency, specify expected start/stop
    times, state the project status, and estimate the amount of
    time needed to complete the project.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Basic Billing/Invoicing Support</b>
<dd>Infrastructure for storing price &amp; billing information has been
     put into place.  This allows billing invoices to be generated.
     Tasks can be marked as bill-able, non-billable, on-hold, or 
     free-of-charge. Billing rates for regular, overtime, 
     double-overtime or flat-fee can be set per task.  
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Sub-Project Support</b>
<dd>New projects can be listed 
     as sub-projects of other projects.  The time totals will show 
     the total including sub-projects.  The Hierarchical tree can be 
     expanded / collapsed to simplify viewing.  The tree can be 
     re-arranged by dragging-n-dropping projects.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Simpler Navigation</b>
<dd>Arrow keys and carriage return now work in the main window.
     Up/down keys can be used to move up & down.  The left/right arrow
     keys expand/collapse a sub-project list.  Hitting return selects
     the project.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Log Journal</b>
<dd>A journal showing explicit start and stop times is maintained.
     Blocks of time can be annotated with memos.  The journal can be 
     exported as an HTML page, or printed (OK, printer support not
     yet finished).
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Auto-Merge/Cleanup of Short Intervals Support</b>
<dd>Extremely short
     intervals (the length is configurable) are automatically removed
     from the logs.  Slightly longer but still short intervals
     are auto-merged into nearby neighbors. Short gaps between intervals
     are coalesced as well.  You can specify a time period of 0 seconds
     to turn these features off.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>HTML-based Reports</b>
<dd>The journal GUI is based on template HTML pages.  If you know
     HTML, then you can create customized report pages.  Particularly
     handy for slapping the company logo and mailing address on the top 
     of the page, and generating a unique, custom look.
     User-defined reports (contained in <tt>ghtml</tt> files) 
     can be added to the
     menus by typing in the filename into the 'new report' GUI dialog.
     Typically, a 'user-defined report' is one with customized layout,
     maybe a logo added, all-spiffed up &amp; such.

     (Note: the HTML table layout architecture was fixed in version 
     <tt>gnotime-2.1.4</tt>, thus allowing far more flexibility
     and far prettier layout. The badness of the design is now gone.)

     (A collection of pre-defined, fancy-loooking invoices are still needed).
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Inactivity Timeout</b>
<dd>If the keyboard or mouse have been idle for more than a configurable
    amount of time, then the project clock is automatically stopped.  
    This prevents projects from accumulating time if you forget to 
    stop them at the end of the day, or during lunch.  A popup then asks
    if the project should be restarted, and allows the amount
    of idle-time credited to the project to be easily adjusted.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Shell Commands</b>
<dd>A shell command can be executed whenever a project timer is 
    started or stopped.  The project title, description and other 
    parameters can be passed to the shell command.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Scheme Extension Language</b>
<dd>Scheme (as provided through the guile interpreter) is used as 
     an extension language, although scheme
     support is currently limited to report generation.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>XML File Format</b>
<dd>All project and journal data are stored in an XML file format.
    This should simplify future interoperability and data access concerns.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Multi-Language Support</b>
<dd>The GnoTime menus and messages have been translated to dozens of 
    languages.  There are message catalogues for the following locales:
    <tt>
    az bg ca cs da de el en_GB es et eu fi fr ga gl hu it ja ko lt lv ms nl
    nn no pl pt pt_BR ro ru sk sl sv ta tr uk vi wa zh_CN zh_TW
    </tt>
    Translations are needed for the manual. (Actually, the manual needs 
    a re-write).
    <br><br>
</dl>

<h1>News</h1>
The latest releases continues to focus on usability and convenience 
features, making GnoTime easier to use and thus more powerful.

	 <br><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>New in the 2.1.5 release</b>
<dd>The main window has been reformulated in a big way:  It
    now includes sub-panels for editing project and diary notes.
    This 'notes area' makes it far more convenient to make
    extensive notes and 'blog' your way through a set of projects.
	 <br><br>
    Also fixes bugs with backup timestamps, also with cut-n-paste
    of project trees.
	 <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.4 release</b>
<dd>The scheme interface re-design has been finished.
    This means that the HTML reports are far, far more
    configurable, and can be made to look much prettier.
    The old, nasty table-formatting features have been removed.
    It also means that tab-delimited export now works cleanly,
    and other export formats can be easily added.
	 <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.3 release</b>
<dd>The time credited to a project after the keyboard inactivity 
    timer has tripped is now very easily adjustable.  Thus, if
    the timer tripped because you were on the phone, you can now
    trivially credit the project with any time, from zero to 
    the full interval since the last keyboard/mouse activity,
    by simply adjusting a slider in the timeout popup.
	 <br><br>

    Backup copies of data automatically saved, automatically
    pruned back, thus providing an archive of old data as well
    as avoiding catastrophic data loss.
	 <br><br>


<dt><b>New in the 2.1.2 release</b>
<dd>A "major" change in the user interface: one must now
    double-click to start a project timer running.  This 
    makes navigation and task editing much easier and more
    robust than the single-click interface, which was prone
    to accidental-click problems, especially on laptop touchpads.
    This makes GnoTime much more usable on laptops.
    The 2.1.2 version is also the first official stable, 
    non-beta release GnoTime. (December 27, 2002)
	 <br><br>
    The 2.1.2 version also included:
	 <ul>
    <li>Added new to-do list report
    <li>Run shell commands when project started/stopped (fixed)
    <li>Added tab-delimited export of to-do list
    <li>Removed cause of possible crashes (buffer over-run
        for large datasets).
    <li>Remember what state tree was left in between sessions.
    <li>Much improved scheme support in reports
    <li>Language translations now included as part of dist
    <li>Can now save HTML reports to file (again)
    <li>Now detects inactivity due to laptop shutdown
    <li>Fix start/stop timer icon in toolbar
    </ul>
</dl>
<br><br>


<h1>Roadmap</h1>
GnoTime still needs some serious work in several areas. Help is needed.
<dl>
<dt><b>GUI Enhancements</b>
<dd>The GUI can be made simpler, easier and more powerful at the same
    time.   This is my current development focus: improve usability
    without adding feature bloat.  Easier said than done.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Better Report Generation</b>
<dd>Certain reports, especially the invoice reports, would benefit
    from a better report generator.  I'd like to add buttons to
	 show/hide completed projects, etc.

    <br><br>
<dt><b>GnuCash Integration</b>
<dd>It should be possible to import GnoTime invoices into GnuCash.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>SQL Support</b>
<dd>A frequent request is for a multi-user version of GnoTime.
    A basic level of multi-user capabilities can be achieved by
    adding support for an SQL backend.  This should be relatively easy,
    as all of the project and journal functions were segregated when
    the XML file format was added.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>Web Tinkering</b>
<dd>GnoTime already uses some of the buzzwords of the web: HTML and XML.
    That makes it an interesting playground for experimenting with
	 web-enabling technology.  Can it be made into a client-server
	 system, running on the open internet?
    <br><br>
<dt><b>Project Management Integration</b>
<dd>It might be interesting to have GnoTime work as applet or 
    embedable component for an extended/sophisticated project 
    management system.  For example, it should be interesting to make
    GnoTime a front end to something like 
	 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/toutdoux/en/index.html">TouxDoux</a>, 
	 or <a href="http://mrproject.codefactory.se/">MrProject</a>
	 or even the web/PHP-based 
	 <a href="http://dcl.sourceforge.net/">
	 Double Choco Latte</a>.  Alternately, GnoTime could
    be integrated into simpler calendar/todo systems, such as Evolution.

<h1>Screenshots</h1>
The following screenshots are from the current Gnome2 version of
GnoTime, unless otherwise noted.
<br><br>
The main window screen, showing all-time and daily totals:
<br>

<br><br>

The same main window screen, but with additional columns
enabled to show project status.   Note the new notes-taking
area at the bottom of the screen.
<br>
<img src="gnome2-main-notes.png">
<br><br>

The inactivity popup dialog, which triggers when
the keyboard and mouse has been idle some period of time.
Note how this allows a project to be credited with an 
adjustable amount of time.  Being able to adjust the time
credited directly, without having to fuss with menus and 
GUI dialogs is a very handy feature when you are distracted by 
interruptions.
<br>
<img src="gnome2-idle-timeout.png">
<br><br>
The dialog box for specifying project-planning status.
The use of this diaolog is optional, but can be useful for 
ranking the importance and urgency of to-do list items.
Note the distinction between importance and urgency:
An <b><i>important</i></b> task is one that must be done,
sooner or later.  An <b><i>urgent</i></b> task should be
done as soon as possible.

Below is the short-form view of journal entries
(this screenshot is from the gnome-1.4.1 version).
Note that this report is is generated as html, 
displayed in a gtkhtml window.
Clicking on the hot-links brings up a popup
menu that allows you to cut, paste and edit the entries.

You can create much better looking reports by modifying
the html template for this report.  If you know html,
this is easy to do.

<h1>Getting GnoTime</h1>
Visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/</a> and follow the links to download tarballs, browse CVS, etc.

<p>
Please use GnoTime version 2.1.1 or later, as available on sourceforge.
Please avoid the gnome-1.4 version, as that version has some known
bugs, limitations and usability problems that won't be getting fixed anytime
soon.

<h2>Bug Tracker</h2>
The recommended bug tracker at this point is the one located at
sourceforge.  Go to the sourceforge project page, and work from there.

<h2>Web Site Mirrors</h2>
There are two web site mirrors:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.linas.org/linux/gtt/gtt.html">http://www.linas.org/linux/gtt/gtt.html</a>
<li><a href="http://gttr.sourceforge.net/">http://gttr.sourceforge.net/</a>
</ul>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
There is a mailing list; see the sourceforge project page for info 
on subscribing.
<p>

<h2>gnome-utils-1-4 Information</h2>
Note that the gnome-1.4 version of GTT/GnoTime is still
available as a part of the 
<tt>gnome-utils</tt> package on <tt>cvs.gnome.org</tt>,
in the <tt>gnome-utils-1-4</tt> branch.

It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
<p>
If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
should check out the gnome-1.4 branch, as follows:
<tt>
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout -r
gnome-utils-1-4 gnome-utils
</tt>

Please note that the gnome-1.4 branch fixes some critical gtt
bugs!  Please note that these fixes are NOT in the latest gnome-utils
tarball!  This means that e.g. Debian-unstable will install a down-level,
buggy version of gtt :-(.   Sigh... (but not for long, I hope)
