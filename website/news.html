    This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
    There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
    likely that it would be much leaner.
    
    However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
    built with tables.

                            images.  A 'publish' function using GnomeVFS makes it easier

                                Also, end-of-day need not be midnight - its now configurable.
                            </li><li> Remove obsolete menu entries (clear daily counters)

                            although it is not used except to perform this simple date query.

                            Toshio Kuratomi provided a major cleanup of the documentation 
                            subsystem.  Goedson Teixeira Paixao provided a new pt_BR translation.
                            A variety of minor bugs were fixed, including a crash of the 
                            'yelp' help browser.

                            day by day, but will also show a bulleted list of tasks worked 
                            that day.  The main window display can now show total hours worked
                            for previous day and previous week.  Sub-projects can now be fetched 
                            via scheme, allowing them to be included in reports.  The scheme
                            subsystem now includes an elementary type system, allowing more
                            complex structures to be built.  A half-dozen different crashes 
                            have been fixed.

                        </dt><dd>The main window has been reformulated in a big way:  It
                            now includes sub-panels for editing project and diary notes.
                            This 'notes area' makes it far more convenient to make
                            extensive notes and 'blog' your way through a set of projects.

                            This means that the HTML reports are far, far more
                            configurable, and can be made to look much prettier.
                            The old, nasty table-formatting features have been removed.
                            It also means that tab-delimited export now works cleanly,
                            and other export formats can be easily added.

                            timer has tripped is now very easily adjustable.  Thus, if
                            the timer tripped because you were on the phone, you can now
                            trivially credit the project with any time, from zero to 
                            the full interval since the last keyboard/mouse activity,
                            by simply adjusting a slider in the timeout popup.

                        </dd><dt><b>New in the 2.1.2 release</b>
                        </dt><dd>A "major" change in the user interface: one must now
                            double-click to start a project timer running.  This 
                            makes navigation and task editing much easier and more
                            robust than the single-click interface, which was prone
                            to accidental-click problems, especially on laptop touchpads.
                            This makes GnoTime much more usable on laptops.
                            The 2.1.2 version is also the first official stable, 
                            non-beta release GnoTime. (December 27, 2002)
                            <br><br>
                            The 2.1.2 version also included:
                            <ul>
                        
                            <li>Added new to-do list report
                            </li><li>Run shell commands when project started/stopped (fixed)
                            </li><li>Added tab-delimited export of to-do list
                            </li><li>Removed cause of possible crashes (buffer over-run
                                for large datasets).
                            </li><li>Remember what state tree was left in between sessions.
                            </li><li>Much improved scheme support in reports
                            </li><li>Language translations now included as part of dist
                            </li><li>Can now save HTML reports to file (again)
                            </li><li>Now detects inactivity due to laptop shutdown
                            </li><li>Fix start/stop timer icon in toolbar
                            </li></ul>
                        
                        </dd><dt><b>History:</b>
                        </dt><dd>GnoTime used to be known as GTT and was a part of the <tt>gnome-utils</tt>
                        
                            package.  It has now been split out of that package, and ported to 
                            Gnome2.  The Gnome2 port is now officially 'stable' and (more-or-less)
                            ready for general, production use.  It does still have a variety 
                            of blemishes, but these don't seem to be show-stoppers at this point.
                            <br><br>
                            Note that the gnome-1.4 version of GTT/GnoTime is still
                            available as a part of the 
                            <tt>gnome-utils</tt> package on <tt>cvs.gnome.org</tt>,
                            in the <tt>gnome-utils-1-4</tt> branch.
                            It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
                            If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
                            recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
                            should check out the gnome-1.4 branch, as follows:
                            <tt>
                        
                            cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout -r
                            gnome-utils-1-4 gnome-utils
                            </tt>
                            Please note that this gnome-1.4 branch fixes some critical gtt
                            bugs!  Please note that these fixes are NOT in the latest 
                            gnome-utils 1.4 tarball!
