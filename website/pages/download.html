            <h3><span>Getting GnoTime</span></h3>

            <p class="p1"><span>Your favorite distribution 
            (Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat/Fedora, SUSE, Fink, Gentoo) already includes 
            pre-compiled binaries/packages of GnoTime, and you should probably 
            be searching those out, and installing and working with those. 
            That way, you at least have some guarantee that its been tested 
            and is known to work with your system.</span></p>
            
            <p class="p1"><span>If you are adventurous, and know how to compile 
            from source, and absolutely must have the latest and greatest 
            version, then visit 
             <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/" title="GnoTime Development Area">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/</a> 
            to get the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=55463" title="direct access to source">source-code tarballs</a>, 
            instructions for CVS access, etc.
