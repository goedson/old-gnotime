                                component which fixes a lot of the bugs regarding the projects 
                                tree manipulation and prepares the way for many customizations

                                of the timer system to make it more system power conservation

                            images.  A 'publish' function using GnomeVFS makes it easier

                            other supported method.  In addition, the following bugs were

                            </li><li> Provides 'infinite undo' for cut projects.
                            </li><li> Keyboard cut (ctrl-x) fixed so that it cuts only if project
                                window has focus.
                            </li><li> Can now specify day-of-week for the start of a new week.
                                Also, end-of-day need not be midnight - its now configurable.
                            </li><li> Remove obsolete menu entries (clear daily counters)
                            </li><li> Fix flyover help on HTML reports

                        </dt><dd>This release adds support for simple report queries.  In particular,
                            reports can now be generated for all tasks that occurred between a
                            pair of dates;  an extremely general query system is now in place,
                            although it is not used except to perform this simple date query.

                            Toshio Kuratomi provided a major cleanup of the documentation 
                            subsystem.  Goedson Teixeira Paixao provided a new pt_BR translation.
                            A variety of minor bugs were fixed, including a crash of the 
                            'yelp' help browser.

                        </dt><dd>The "Daily Report" will show not only the total hours worked,
                            day by day, but will also show a bulleted list of tasks worked 
                            that day.  The main window display can now show total hours worked
                            for previous day and previous week.  Sub-projects can now be fetched 
                            via scheme, allowing them to be included in reports.  The scheme
                            subsystem now includes an elementary type system, allowing more
                            complex structures to be built.  A half-dozen different crashes 
                            have been fixed.

                        </dt><dd>The main window has been reformulated in a big way:  It
                            now includes sub-panels for editing project and diary notes.
                            This 'notes area' makes it far more convenient to make
                            extensive notes and 'blog' your way through a set of projects.
                            <br><br>

                            This means that the HTML reports are far, far more
                            configurable, and can be made to look much prettier.
                            The old, nasty table-formatting features have been removed.
                            It also means that tab-delimited export now works cleanly,
                            and other export formats can be easily added.

                            trivially credit the project with any time, from zero to 
                            the full interval since the last keyboard/mouse activity,
                            by simply adjusting a slider in the timeout popup.

                            robust than the single-click interface, which was prone
                            to accidental-click problems, especially on laptop touchpads.
                            This makes GnoTime much more usable on laptops.
                            The 2.1.2 version is also the first official stable, 
                            non-beta release GnoTime. (December 27, 2002)

                        </dt><dd>GnoTime used to be known as GTT and was a part of the <tt>gnome-utils</tt>
                        
                            package.  It has now been split out of that package, and ported to 
                            Gnome2.  The Gnome2 port is now officially 'stable' and (more-or-less)
                            ready for general, production use.  It does still have a variety 
                            of blemishes, but these don't seem to be show-stoppers at this point.
                            <br><br>
                            Note that the gnome-1.4 version of GTT/GnoTime is still
                            available as a part of the 
                            <tt>gnome-utils</tt> package on <tt>cvs.gnome.org</tt>,
                            in the <tt>gnome-utils-1-4</tt> branch.
                            It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
                            If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
                            recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
