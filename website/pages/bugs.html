            If you found a bug, please rest assured that we will not fix it unless 
            you report it (and even then, it may take us a while). </span></p>

            To report a bug, please visit the 
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=55463&atid=477103" title="Submitting Bugs">SourceForge tracker</a>, and follow the links.
            The same remarks apply for feature requests and patches. 
            The best place to submit a patch is to sourceforge. That way, we won't loose track of it.
