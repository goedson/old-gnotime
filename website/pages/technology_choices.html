            <h3><span>GnoTime - The Gnome Time Tracker (GTT)</span></h3>
            <p class="p1"><span>GnoTime is currently written mostly in C and a little bit of
                                <a href="http://www.schemers.org/" title="Scheme">Scheme</a>. 
                                C is used to implement all of the core functions, whereas Scheme is 
                                used to generate the HTML reports. 
                                The Scheme/HTML combo was chosen in order to make it easy to 
                                customize reports, while allowing the result to be easily viewed 
                                in a browser, sent by email, etc. The GUI system is all in Gnome, 
                                using the Glade interface designer. The file format is in XML, 
                                following current trends. There are some interesting directions 
                                one could play with. For example, rather than creating reports 
                                with embedded Scheme, one could try to use GnoTime's XML data 
                                format as a mirror of its internal state, and then use 
                                <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/" title="DOM">DOM</a> to 
                                extract various parts out of it, and thus build reports that way. </span></p>
