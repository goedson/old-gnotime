    This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
    There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
    likely that it would be much leaner.
    
    However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
    built with tables.
