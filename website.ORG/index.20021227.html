<br>

The Gnome Time Tracker is a desktop utility for tracking
the amount of time spent on projects, and generating configurable
reports and invoices based on that time.  
<p>
GnoTime used to be known as GTT and was a part of the <tt>gnome-utils</tt>
package.  It has now been split out of that package, and ported to 
Gnome2.  The Gnome2 port is now officially 'stable' and (more-or-less)
ready for general, production use.  It does still have a variety 
of blemishes, but these don't seem to be show-stoppers at this point.
<p>
GnoTime has the following features:
<dl>
<dt><b>Basic Stop-Watch Support</b>
<dd>At its core, GnoTime is a fancy stop-watch: you can click on
    an icon to start and stop one of any number of timers.
    It is the times measured by these clocks that make up
    the core data that GnoTime works with.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Project Planning Support</b>
<dd>Well, OK, "project planning" may be an overstatement.  But GnoTime
    does provide basic to-do list support, including the ability 
    to rank by importance and urgency, specify expected start/stop
    times, state the project status, and estimate the amount of
    time needed to complete the project.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Basic Billing/Invoicing Support</b>
<dd>Infrastructure for storing price &amp; billing information has been
     put into place.  This allows billing invoices to be generated.
     Tasks can be marked as billable, non-billable, on-hold, or 
     free-of-charge. Billing rates for regular, overtime, 
     double-overtime or flat-fee can be set per task.  
     (Fancier-looking invoices are still needed).
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Sub-Project Support</b>
<dd>New projects can be listed 
     as sub-projects of other projects.  The time totals will show 
     the total including sub-projects.  The Hierarchical tree can be 
     expanded / collapsed to simplify viewing.  The tree can be 
     re-arranged by dragging-n-dropping projects.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Simpler Navigation</b>
<dd>Arrow keys and carriage return now work in the main window.
     Up/down keys can be used to move up & down.  The left/right arrow
     keys expand/collapse a sub-project list.  Hitting return selects
     the project.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Log Journal</b>
<dd>A journal showing explicit start and stop times is maintained.
     Blocks of time can be annotated with memos.  The journal can be 
     exported as an html page, or printed (OK, printer support not
     yet finished).
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Auto-merge/cleanup of Short Intervals Support</b>
<dd>Extremely short
     intervals (the length is configurable) are automatically removed
     from the logs.  Slightly longer but still short intervals
     are auto-merged into nearby neighbors. Short gaps between intervals
     are coalesced as well.  You can specify a time period of 0 seconds
     to turn these features off.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>HTML-based GUI</b>
<dd>The journal GUI is based on extended html pages.  If you know
     HTML, then you can create customized report pages.  Particularly
     handy for slapping the company logo and mailing address on the top 
     of the page, and generating a unique, custom look.
     User-defined reports (contained in ghtml files) can be added to the
     menus by typing in the filename into the 'new report' GUI dialog.
     Typically, a 'user-defined report' is one with customized layout,
     maybe a logo added, all-spiffed up & such.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Inactivity Timeout</b>
<dd>An inactivity timeout has been implemented. If the keyboard
     or mouse have been idle for more than some period of time, then 
     the clock is stopped.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Shell Commands</b>
<dd>A shell command can be executed whenever a project timer is 
    started or stopped.  The project title, description and other 
    parameters can be passed to the shell command.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Scheme Extension Language</b>
<dd>Scheme (as provided through the guile interpreter) is used as 
     an extension language, although scheme
     support is currently limited to report generation.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>XML File Format</b>
<dd>All project and journal data are stored in an XML file format.
    This should simplify future interoperability and data access concerns.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Multi-Language Support</b>
<dd>The GnoTime menus and messages have been translated to dozens of 
    languages.
    Translations are needed for the manual. (Actually, the manual needs 
    a re-write).
    <br><br>
</dl>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
Volunteers are needed to take GnoTime in a variety of possible directions:
<dl>
<dt><b>Better Billing Support</b>
<dd>Better and more complex invoices are needed, as well as the ability
    bill line items.  Part of this work should be better integration 
    with GnuCash.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>SQL Support</b>
<dd>A basic level of multi-user capabilities can be achieved by
    adding support for an SQL backend.  This should be relatively easy,
    as all of the project and journal functions were segregated when
    the XML file format was added.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>ASP Model</b>
<dd>A web-like client server system that could work over the open Internet
    is possible, and shouldn't be too hard.  GnoTime now contains an html viewer,
    and the XML file format should be usable for a network interface.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>Project Management Integration</b>
<dd>GnoTime is ready to act as an applet for an extended/sophisticated project 
    management system.  For example, it should be interesting to make
    GnoTime a front end to something like TouxDoux.  Alternately, GnoTime could
    be integrated into simpler calendar/todo systems, such as Evolution.

<h1>Screenshots</h1>
The following screenshots are from the gnome-utils-1.4 version of 
GnoTime.  The Gnome2 screenshots are substantially the same, although
Gnome2 uses smaller default fonts and has other minor differences in
layout.

<h1>Getting GnoTime</h1>
Visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/</a> and follow the links to download tarballs, browse CVS, etc.

<p>
Please use GnoTime version 2.1.1 or later, as available on sourceforge.
Please avoid the gnome-1.4 version, as that version has some known
bugs, limitations and usability problems that won't be getting fixed anytime
soon.

<h2>Bug Tracker</h2>
The recommended bug tracker at this point is the one located at
sourceforge.  Go to the sourceforge project page, and work from there.

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
There is a mailing list; see the sourceforge project page for info 
on subscribing.
<p>

<h2>gnome-utils-1-4 Information</h2>
Note that the gnome-1.4 version of GTT/GnoTime is still
available as a part of the 
<tt>gnome-utils</tt> package on <tt>cvs.gnome.org</tt>,
in the <tt>gnome-utils-1-4</tt> branch.

It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
<p>
If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
should check out the gnome-1.4 branch, as follows:
<tt>
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout -r
gnome-utils-1-4 gnome-utils
</tt>

Please note that the gnome-1.4 branch fixes some critical gtt
bugs!  Please note that these fixes are NOT in the latest gnome-utils
tarball!  This means that e.g. Debian-unstable will install a down-level,
buggy version of gtt :-(.   Sigh... (but not for long, I hope)

In memory of the World Trade Center bombing, when a lot of the gtt 
code got written.
