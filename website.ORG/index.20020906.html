<br>
<p><b>Note:</b> We are currently in the process of moving things 
over to sourceforge.
This is the old web page, which should give you some idea what we're
about.</p>

The Gnome Time Tracker is a desktop utility for tracking
the amount of time spent on projects, and generating configurable
invoices based on that time.  
<p>
GTT has the following features:
<dl>
<dt><b>Basic Stop-Watch Support</b>
<dd>At its core, GTT is a fancy stop-watch: you can click on
    an icon to start and stop one of any number of timers.
    It is the times measured by these clocks that make up
    the core data that GTT works with.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Project Planning Support</b>
<dd>Well, OK, "project planning" may be an overstatment.  But GTT
    does provide basic to-do list support, including the ability 
    to rank by importance and urgency, specify expected start/stop
    times, state the project status, and estimate the amount of
    time needed to complete the project.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Basic Billing/Invoicing Support</b>
<dd>Infrastructure for storing price & billing information has been
     put into place.  This allows billing invoices to be generated.
     Tasks can be marked as billable, non-billable, on-hold, or 
     free-of-charge. Billing rates for regular, overtime, 
     double-overtime or flat-fee can be set per task.  
     (Fancier-looking invoices still needed).
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Sub-Project Support</b>
<dd>New projects can be listed 
     as sub-projects of other projects.  The time totals will show 
     the total including sub-projects.  The Hierarchical tree can be 
     expanded / collapsed to simplify viewing.  The tree can be 
     re-arranged by dragging-n-dropping projects.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Simpler Navigation</b>
<dd>Arrow keys and carriage return now work in the main window.
     Up/down keys can be used to move up & down.  The left/right arrow
     keys expand/collapse a sub-project list.  Hitting return selects
     the project.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Log Journal</b>
<dd>A journal showing explicit start and stop times is maintained.
     Blocks of time can be annotated with memos.  The journal can be 
     exported as an html page, or printed (OK, printer support not
     yet finished).
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Auto-merge/cleanup of Short Intervals Support</b>
<dd>Extremely short
     intervals (the length is configurable) are automatically removed
     from the logs.  Slightly longer but still short intervals
     are auto-merged into nearby neighbors. Short gaps between intervals
     are coalesced as well.  You can specify a time period of 0 seconds
     to turn these features off.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>HTML-based GUI</b>
<dd>The journal GUI is based on extended html pages.  If you know
     HTML, then you can create customized report pages.  Particularly
     handy for slapping the company logo and mailing address on the top 
     of the page, and generating a unique, custom look.
     User-defined reports (contained in ghtml files) can be added to the
     menus by typing in the filename into the 'new report' GUI dialog.
     Typically, a 'user-defined report' is one with customized layout,
     maybe a logo added, all-spiffed up & such.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Inactivity Timeout</b>
<dd>An inactivity timeout has been implemented. If the keyboard
     or mouse have been idle for more than some period of time, then 
     the clock is stopped.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Shell Commands</b>
<dd>A shell command can be executed whenever a project timer is 
    started or stopped.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Scheme Extension Language</b>
<dd>Scheme (guile) is used as an extension language, although scheme
     support is currently limited to report generation.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>XML File Format</b>
<dd>All project and journal data are stored in an XML file format.
    This should simplify future interoperability and data access concerns.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Multi-Language Support</b>
<dd>The basic GTT menus have been translated to dozens of languages.
    Translations are need for the manual. (Actually, the manual needs 
    a re-write).
    <br><br>
</dl>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
Volunteers are needed to take GTT in a variety of possible directions:
<dl>
<dt><b>Better Billing Support</b>
<dd>Better and more complex invoices are needed, as well as the ability
    bill line items.  Part of this work should be better integration 
    with GnuCash.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>SQL Support</b>
<dd>A basic level of multi-user capabilities can be achieved by
    adding support for an SQL backend.  This should be relatively easy,
    as all of the project and journal functions were segregated when
    the XML file format was added.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>ASP Model</b>
<dd>A web-like client server system that could work over the open Internet
    is possible, and shouldn't be too hard.  GTT now contains an html viewer,
    and the XML file format should be usable for a network interface.
    <br><br>
<dt><b>Project Management Integration</b>
<dd>GTT is ready to act as an applet for an extended/sophisticated project 
    management system.  For example, it should be interesting to make
    GTT a front end to something like TouxDoux.  Alternately, GTT could
    be integrated into simpler calendar/todo systems, such as Evolution.

<h1>Getting GnoTime</h1>
Visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/</a>
<p>
Note that GTT/GnoTime used to be available as a part of the gnome-utils
package (this is still true, in fact, for the gnome-utils-1.4 branch).
It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
<p>
Pre-compiled binaries (none yet):
<p>
If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
should check out the gnome-1.4 branch, as follows:
<tt>
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout -r
gnome-utils-1-4 gnome-utils
</tt>

Please note that the gnome-1.4 branch fixes some critical gtt
bugs!  Please note that these fixes are NOT in the latest gnome-utils
tarball!  This means that e.g. Debain-unstable will install a down-level,
buggy version of gtt :-(.   Sigh ...

In memory of the World Trade Center bombing, when a lot of the gtt 
code got written.
