<h1>GnoTime Older News Posts</h1>

The Gnome Time Tracker is a to-do list/diary/journal tool
that can track the amount of time spent on projects, and,
among other things, generate reports and invoices based on 
that time.  It's been used it to keep shopping lists, organize ideas, 
track bug reports, keep a diary of activities, provide 
weekly status reports to management, and even as a consultant billing
system.  

<h1>Older News</h1>
The following is an archive of earlier news items for this project:

    <br><br>
<dl>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.3 release</b>
<dd>The time credited to a project after the keyboard inactivity 
    timer has tripped is now very easily adjustable.  Thus, if
    the timer tripped because you were on the phone, you can now
    trivially credit the project with any time, from zero to 
    the full interval since the last keyboard/mouse activity,
    by simply adjusting a slider in the timeout popup.
    <br><br>

    Backup copies of data automatically saved, automatically
    pruned back, thus providing an archive of old data as well
    as avoiding catastrophic data loss.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.2 release</b>
<dd>A "major" change in the user interface: one must now
    double-click to start a project timer running.  This 
    makes navigation and task editing much easier and more
    robust than the single-click interface, which was prone
    to accidental-click problems, especially on laptop touchpads.
    This makes GnoTime much more usable on laptops.
    The 2.1.2 version is also the first official stable, 
    non-beta release GnoTime. (December 27, 2002)
    <br><br>
    The 2.1.2 version also included:
    <ul>
    <li>Added new to-do list report
    <li>Run shell commands when project started/stopped (fixed)
    <li>Added tab-delimited export of to-do list
    <li>Removed cause of possible crashes (buffer over-run
        for large datasets).
    <li>Remember what state tree was left in between sessions.
    <li>Much improved scheme support in reports
    <li>Language translations now included as part of dist
    <li>Can now save HTML reports to file (again)
    <li>Now detects inactivity due to laptop shutdown
    <li>Fix start/stop timer icon in toolbar
    </ul>

<dt><b>History:</b>
<dd>GnoTime used to be known as GTT and was a part of the <tt>gnome-utils</tt>
    package.  It has now been split out of that package, and ported to 
    Gnome2.  The Gnome2 port is now officially 'stable' and (more-or-less)
    ready for general, production use.  It does still have a variety 
    of blemishes, but these don't seem to be show-stoppers at this point.
    <p>
    Note that the gnome-1.4 version of GTT/GnoTime is still
    available as a part of the 
    <tt>gnome-utils</tt> package on <tt>cvs.gnome.org</tt>,
    in the <tt>gnome-utils-1-4</tt> branch.
    It is <b>NO LONGER A PART OF GNOME_UTILS-2.0</b>
    If you are interested in gtt version 1.4, and want the most 
    recent gnome-1.4 CVS source, you
    should check out the gnome-1.4 branch, as follows:
    <tt>
    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome checkout -r
    gnome-utils-1-4 gnome-utils
    </tt>
    Please note that this gnome-1.4 branch fixes some critical gtt
    bugs!  Please note that these fixes are NOT in the latest 
    gnome-utils 1.4 tarball!

the first major revision of gtt was being written.
