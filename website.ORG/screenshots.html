<h1>GnoTime Screenshots</h1>
The following screenshots are from the current Gnome2 version of
GnoTime, unless otherwise noted.
<br><br>
The main window screen, showing all-time and daily totals:
<br>

<br><br>

The same main window screen, but with additional columns
enabled to show project status.   Note the new notes-taking
area at the bottom of the screen.
<br>

<br><br>

The inactivity popup dialog, which triggers when
the keyboard and mouse has been idle some period of time.
Note how this allows a project to be credited with an 
adjustable amount of time.  Being able to adjust the time
credited directly, without having to fuss with menus and 
GUI dialogs is a very handy feature when you are distracted by 
interruptions.

<br><br>
The dialog box for specifying project-planning status.
The use of this dialog is optional, but can be useful for 
ranking the importance and urgency of to-do list items.
Note the distinction between importance and urgency:
An <b><i>important</i></b> task is one that must be done,
sooner or later.  An <b><i>urgent</i></b> task should be
done as soon as possible.

Below is a view of the time report, as viewed by
the built-in HTML viewer.  Because this report is just
plain HTML, it can be saved to a file, emailed, or 
posted to a web site. 
<a href="example-time-report.html">Here's the 
same report, as a web page</a>.
<br>
<img src="gtt-2.2.0-journal.png">
<br><br>
Here are some other reports that GnoTime can generate:
<ul>
<li>Here's the <a href="example-journal.html">'Journal'
    report</a>, a view of the same data, 
    presented in a blog-like diary format.
<li>Here's an <a href="example-invoice.html">example invoice</a>
    based on the same data (actually, a bit more data to 
    make a better example).
<li>Here's the same data, presented as a 
    <a href="example-daily-report.html">Daily Activity Report</a>.

<li>A <a href="roadmap.html">Status Report</a>, showing 
    a list of projects, and a writeup of the status of each.
    Yes, this status report just happens, quite by accident, 
    to be reporting the status of some future GnoTime features.
<li>Here's the same status report, presented
    with the <a href="example-todo.html">To-Do Report</a>.
</ul>
<br><br>
All of the above reports are generated from report templates
written in HTML, with embeded markup to display the various
bits of data.  This means that if you are knowledgable in 
HTML you can readily modify these report templates, and 
design your own reports.  In particular, if you hate these
colors and style, you can change them as you wish.
<br><br>
When you view these reports natively in GnoTime, each of the 
entries shows up as a hyper-link. You can click on each link
to bring up a menu, and then, from the menu, edit, add or 
cut-n-paste entires. For example,
individual time intervals may be modified.

Per-project billing rates can be specified ...
<br>
<img src="proj-rates.gif">
<br><br>

As well as how an individual task should be billed.

<h2>Works on Apple Mac OSX too</h2>
Well, sort of.  Here's a screenshot under Macintosh OSX Fink;
unfortunately, this port was never finished/published.

the first major revision of gtt was being written.
