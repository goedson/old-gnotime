The Gnome Time Tracker is a to-do list/diary/journal tool
that can track the amount of time spent on projects, and,
among other things, generate reports and invoices based on 
that time.  It's being used it to keep shopping lists, 
organize ideas, track bug reports, keep a diary of activities, 
do some blogging, provide weekly status reports to management, 
and even as a consultant billing system.  The reason it can 
be used for all of these things is that it supports five basic, 
simple features:

     <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Multiple <b>To-Do Lists</b> that can be sorted by the 
    priority/importance of the tasks in the list.  The to-do
    items can be organized into categories, arranged in a
    hierarchical way.  This makes it easy to maintain 
    both business and personal items in the list, or
    handle many different projects, while keeping them
    separate from each other.
     <br><br>
<li>A pair of <b>Diary/Journal</b> areas that can be used 
    to keep long and detailed notes and diary entries.
    The project description area allows a multi-paragraph 
    description or status to be typed in.  The diary 
    area allows day-to-day notes to be associated with
    a set of timestamps, so that one has a record of what
    one did on any given day.
     <br><br>
<li>A <b>Running Timer</b>, with time totals, for each 
    project/task.  One starts the timer by clicking on a 
    task: it will measure the amount of time that you are
    in front of the computer.  If it detects that the 
    keyboard/mouse are idle, it will stop the clock.  
    If the clock stays stopped too long, it will nag you to 
    start it up again.  You can view time totals by day, 
    week, month or year.
     <br><br>
<li>A <b>Billing Status</b> dialog for each diary entry. 
    You can mark any given diary entry as bill-able/non-bill-able,
    paid or pending, and set the billing rate. Each
    project can also be marked up with a set of 
    project-planning information: planed start, end and 
    due dates, hours to finish, percent-complete.  
    This is in addition to assigning an urgency/importance
    to each project, as well as a status (completed/in-progress
    not-started/canceled).
     <br><br>
<li>A half-dozen different HTML <b>Reports</b> that can
    slice and dice your lists.  There's a Journal report
    that shows all of the diary entries for one given project. 
    There's an Invoice
    report that summarizes the time spent on each entry,
    and computes a dollar amount for it.  There's a Status
    Report that prints the title of each project, together
    with the paragraph-long descriptions of each.  There's
    a ToDo report, which prints only the project title, the 
    importance/urgency, and the completed/in-progress/not-started 
    status.  The Daily report summarizes the total time
    spent on a day-by-day basis, and lists each of the projects
    that were worked on in a given day. Each of these reports
    can be customized.  And, because they're HTML, you can
    even publish them as web pages.  (Yes, I've thought of
    using GnoTime as a weblog management/publishing tool).
     <br><br>
</ul>


<h2>More About Some of These Features</h2>
We'd like to tell you a bit more about some of the features.
But first, we want to tell you that GnoTime is Free Software,
distributed under the GPL License, for the Linux, Mac OSX and
other Unix desktops.  No, it does *not* for MS Windows.  Sorry.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Simple GUI, Simple Navigation</b>
<dd>We've worked to try to make the GUI as simple as we can,
    and we're not done yet.  GnoTime will auto-save data,
    so that you don't have to.  (It also means no data loss
    if something crashes).  The hierarchical tree of projects
    is managed through drag-n-drop, and can be navigated from
    the keyboard, with arrows keys and carriage returns.
    The left/right arrow keys expand/collapse project lists.
    Hitting return starts and stops the timer.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Auto-Merge/Cleanup of Short Intervals Support</b>
<dd> We also try to unclutter a mess of timer stops/starts
     by trying to clean up time-keeping cruft.
     Extremely short time intervals are automatically removed
     from the logs (the length is configurable).  
     Slightly longer but still short intervals
     are auto-merged into nearby neighbors. Short gaps between intervals
     are coalesced as well.  You can specify a time period of 0 seconds
     to turn these features off.
     <br><br>

<dt><b>User-Customizable HTML-based Reports</b>
<dd>The journal/report GUI is based on template HTML pages.  If you know
     HTML, then you can create customized report pages.  Particularly
     handy for slapping the company logo and mailing address on the top 
     of the page, and generating a unique, custom look.
     User-defined reports (contained in <tt>ghtml</tt> files) 
     can be added to the
     menus by typing in the filename into the 'New Report' GUI dialog.
     <br><br>
     Admittedly, hacking on HTML templates is not the easiest
     thing in the world:  you can't (yet) customize reports
     with a WYSIWYG editor (although we are contemplating one).
     But we figure that HTML can't be that hard: the nerd in 
     you will not be intimidated.  It might be a bit scary to
     mention scheme at this point, but lets just say that
     you can be totally ignorant of scheme and still be able
     to do some pretty fancy customization, above and beyond
     what HTML lets you do, by hacking on the scheme in the report
     templates.
     <br><br>
     Fresh in version 2.1.9 is the ability to embed simple SQL 
     queries in the report templates.  We know that many of you
     power users know SQL, so we figure you'll like this.  The
     SQL gives you the ability to query for only those projects/tasks
     that meet a certain criteria, which is handy if you've got 
     years worth of data and years worth of project lists and 
     to-do items, and you want to just fish out the ones from 
     last month.  
     <br><br>
     Disclaimer: we're still working on SQL support. It works,
     but you can't yet query everything.
     
     <br><br>

<dt><b>Shell Commands</b>
<dd>A shell command can be executed whenever a project timer is 
    started or stopped.  The project title, description and other 
    parameters can be passed to the shell command.  We don't know
    what the hell you power users do with this feature; its 
    been in GTT since the very earliest releases. 
     <br><br>

<dt><b>XML File Format</b>
<dd>All project and journal data are stored in an XML file format.
    The XML file accurately reflects the internal state of the 
    GnoTime data, and therefore generic XML tools should be able
    to perform interesting transformations on this data.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>Multi-Language Support</b>
<dd>The GnoTime menus and messages have been translated to dozens of 
    languages.  There are message catalogs for the following locales:
    <tt>
    az bg ca cs da de el en_GB es et eu fi fr ga gl hu it ja ko lt lv ms nl
    nn no pl pt pt_BR ro ru sk sl sv ta tr uk vi wa zh_CN zh_TW
    </tt>
    Some of these translations need an update; they're quite old and
    out of date. We need help here.
    Translations are needed for the manual. Actually, the manual needs 
    a complete re-write; its three years old, and doesn't discuss most 
    of the newer features.

<h1>Screenshots</h1>
Below are a couple of screenshots from the current 
Gnome2 version of GnoTime. 
<a href="screenshots.html">The screenshots pages shows more</a>.
<br><br>
The main window screen, showing all-time and daily totals:
<br>

<br><br>

The same main window screen, but with additional columns
enabled to show project status.   Note the new notes-taking
area at the bottom of the screen.
<br>
<img src="gnome2-main-notes.png">
<br><br>

<h2>Works on Apple Mac OSX too</h2>
Well, sort-of.  Here's a screenshot of a port under Macintosh OSX Fink;
unfortunately, this port was never finished/published.
<br>
<img src="mac-osx.png">
<br><br>

<h1>Getting GnoTime</h1>
Your favorite distribution (Debian, RedHat/Fedora, SUSE, Fink) already
includes pre-compiled binaries of GnoTime, and you should probably
be searching those out, and installing and working with those.
That way, you at least have some guarantee that its been tested 
and is known to work with your system.
<p>
If you are adventurous, and know how to compile from source, 
and absolutely must have the latest and greatest version, then
visit 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/</a>
to get the source-code tarballs, instructions for CVS access, etc.

<h2>Reporting Bugs, Requesting Features, Submitting Patches</h2>
If you found a bug, please rest assured that we will 
<b><i>not</i></b> fix it unless you report it (and even then,
it may take us a while).  To report a bug, please visit the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">SourceForge 
project site</a>, and follow the links.
The same remarks apply for feature requests and patches.
The best place to submit a patch is to sourceforge.  That
way, we won't loose track of it.

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
If you have questions, want to make comments, or engage in 
general discussions, you can subscribe to the mailing list,
or you can post to the discussion bulletin-board.  You can get
to either through the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">SourceForge 
project page</a>.

    </ul>
<dt><b>New in the 2.2.0 release</b> (April 2004)
<dd>This release sports a brand-new look-n-feel for the reports,
    together with improved URL support.
    The reports now use CSS style sheets, and can contain embedded 
    images.  A 'publish' function using GnomeVFS makes it easier 
    to copy reports to other systems, using ssh, ftp, http or any 
    other supported method.  In addition, the following bugs were 
    fixed:
    <ul>
    <li>Crashes when 'help' button clicked in certain dialogs.
    <li>Corruption of 'reports' menu, followed by crash.
    <li>Fix flyover help to actually work.
    <li>Add missing 'copy' to interval edit popup menu.
    </ul>
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.9 release</b> (April 2004)
<dd>This release fixes a number of bugs in earlier releases.
    <ul>
    <li> Keyboard events were not resetting the timeout
    <li> Fix Help system so that help actually starts up.
    <li> Fix old, multiple scheme bugs affecting billing reports.

    <li> Can now specify day-of-week for the start of a new week.
         Also, end-of-day need not be midnight - its now configurable.
    <li> Remove obsolete menu entries (clear daily counters)
    <li> Fix flyover help on HTML reports
    <li> Fix order of yesterday/today columns.
    <li> Improve checks for Guile during builds
    <li> New whiz-bang SQL for reports.
    </ul>
    <br><br>


<dt><b>New in the 2.1.8 release</b> (April 2004)
<dd>This release adds support for simple report queries.  In particular,
    reports can now be generated for all tasks that occurred between a
    pair of dates;  an extremely general query system is now in place,
    although it is not used except to perform this simple date query.
    <br><br>
    Toshio Kuratomi provided a major cleanup of the documentation 
    subsystem.  Goedson Teixeira Paixao provided a new pt_BR translation.
    A variety of minor bugs were fixed, including a crash of the 
    'yelp' help browser.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.7 release</b> (June 2003)
<dd>Version 2.1.7 fixes some internationalization bugs, and ports the 
    configuration system to GConf2. The 'custom reports' menu is now 
    editable.  
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.6 release</b>
<dd>The "Daily Report" will show not only the total hours worked,
    day by day, but will also show a bulleted list of tasks worked 
    that day.  The main window display can now show total hours worked
    for previous day and previous week.  Sub-projects can now be fetched 
    via scheme, allowing them to be included in reports.  The scheme
    subsystem now includes an elementary type system, allowing more
    complex structures to be built.  A half-dozen different crashes 
    have been fixed.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.5 release</b> (January 2003)
<dd>The main window has been reformulated in a big way:  It
    now includes sub-panels for editing project and diary notes.
    This 'notes area' makes it far more convenient to make
    extensive notes and 'blog' your way through a set of projects.
    <br><br>
    Also fixes bugs with backup timestamps, also with cut-n-paste
    of project trees.
    <br><br>

<dt><b>New in the 2.1.4 release</b> (December 2002)
<dd>The scheme interface re-design has been finished.
    This means that the HTML reports are far, far more
    configurable, and can be made to look much prettier.
    The old, nasty table-formatting features have been removed.
    It also means that tab-delimited export now works cleanly,
    and other export formats can be easily added.

<h1>Technology Choices/Overview</h1>
GnoTime is currently written mostly in C and a little bit of 
<a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>. C is used to implement 
all of the core functions, whereas Scheme is used to generate the 
HTML reports.  The Scheme/HTML combo was chosen in order to make
it easy to customize reports, while allowing the result to be easily
viewed in a browser, sent by email, etc.  The GUI system is 
all in Gnome, using the Glade interface designer.
The file format is in XML, following current trends.
<br><br>
There are some interesting directions one could play with.
For example, rather than creating reports with embedded 
Scheme, one could try to use GnoTime's XML data format 
as a mirror of its internal state, and then use 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">DOM</a> to extract 
various parts out of it, and thus build reports that way.
